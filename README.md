# IoT Poultry Egg Incubator

This is a repository for an IoT-based Poultry Egg Incubator project. The project aims to create an automated egg incubator system that can monitor and control the temperature and humidity levels required for successful egg incubation. The system incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable remote monitoring and control of the incubator.

## Features

- Automated temperature and humidity control for optimal egg incubation conditions.
- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity levels.
- Remote access and control via a web-based interface.
- Notifications and alerts for critical events (e.g., temperature/humidity deviations, power outages).
- Data logging and visualization for analysis and historical tracking.
- User-friendly interface for easy configuration and operation.

## Hardware Requirements

- [PlatformIO compatible microcontroller board](https://platformio.org/boards)
- Temperature and humidity sensors (e.g., DHT11, DHT22, BME280)
- Relay module for controlling heating/cooling elements
- WiFi module (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32) for IoT connectivity

## Software Requirements

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - A cross-platform build system and library manager for embedded development.
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - An open-source electronics platform for developing embedded projects.
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) - An MQTT client library for Arduino used for MQTT communication with the IoT platform.
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) - ArduinoJson is a C++ JSON library for Arduino and IoT (Internet Of Things)
- [DHT sensor library for ESPx](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/DHTesp) - An Arduino library for reading the DHT family of temperature and humidity sensors.
